# samba_exporter

A prometheus exporter for statistic data of the samba file server.

It uses smbstatus to collect the data and converts the result into prometheus style data.
The prometheus style data can be requested manually on port 9922 using a http client. Or a prometheus database sever can be configured to collect the data by scraping port 9922 on the samba server.

**Tested only on Ubuntu 20.04**

## Concept

Since the tool [smbstatus](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbstatus.1.html) provided by the [samba](https://www.samba.org/) project can only run with elevated rights, and a [prometheus exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/) always exposes a public network endpoint, the samba_exporter package contains two services.

- **samba_exporter**: The prometheus exporter service that exposes the public network endpoint for the prometheus server to collect the data running as non privileged user
- **samba_statusd**: The service uses `smbstatus` to collect data and return it when requested running as privileged user

Both services can communicate using a named pipe owned by a common group.

## Installation

### Launchpad

The **samba exporter** package is published on [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~imker/+archive/ubuntu/samba-exporter-ppa). To install from there do the following commands:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:imker/samba-exporter-ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install samba-exporter
```

### GitHub

Install the [latest Release](https://github.com/imker25/samba_exporter/releases/latest) by downloading the debian package and installing it. For example:

```sh
wget https://github.com/imker25/samba_exporter/releases/download/0.1.192-pre/samba-exporter_0.1.192-f6b01a7+ubuntu-20.04_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg --install ./samba-exporter_0.1.192-f6b01a7+ubuntu-20.04_amd64.deb
```

**Hint:** Link and file name needs to be adapted to the latest release.

It's also possible to download and install pre-releases from the GitHub this way.

For manual installation see [Build and manual install](#build-and-manual-install).


## Usage

It's is assumed both services are installed as shown in the [installation](#Installation) section.

By default the prometheus exporter endpoint only listen on localhost. To change this behavior update `/etc/default/samba_exporter` according to your needs and restart the `samba_exporter` service. See [samba_statusd service](#samba_statusd-service) for details.

### samba_statusd service

To change the behavior of the samba_statusd service update the `/etc/default/samba_statusd` according to your needs. You can add any option shown in the help output of `samba_statusd` to the `ARGS` variable.

Get help:

```sh
samba_statusd -help
samba_statusd: Wrapper for smbstatus. Collects data used by the samba_exporter service.
Program Version: 0.1.164-2c3eda2

Usage: ./bin/samba_statusd [options]
Options:
  -help
        Print this help message
  -print-version
        With this flag the program will only print it's version and exit
  -test-mode
        Run the program in test mode. In this mode the program will always return the same test data. To work with samba_exporter both programs needs to run in test mode or not.
  -verbose
        With this flag the program will print verbose output
```

You may not want to start the service with arguments that will exit before listening starts like `-help` or `-print-version`.

To stop, start or restart the service use `systemctl`, e. g.: `sudo systemctl stop samba_statusd`. To read the log output use `journalctl`, e. g. `sudo journalctl -u samba_statusd`.

**Remark:** Due to the services dependencies `samba_exporter` service stops whenever `samba_statusd` stops. And `samba_statusd` always starts when `samba_exporter` is started if not already running.

### samba_exporter service

To change the behavior of the samba_exporter service update the `/etc/default/samba_exporter` according to your needs. You can add any option shown in the help output of `samba_exporter` to the `ARGS` variable.

Get help:

```sh
samba_exporter -help     
samba_exporter: prometheus exporter for the samba file server. Collects data using the samba_statusd service.
Program Version: 0.1.164-2c3eda2

Usage: ./bin/samba_exporter [options]
Options:
  -help
        Print this help message
  -print-version
        With this flag the program will only print it's version and exit
  -request-timeout int
        The timeout for a request to samba_statusd in seconds (default 5)        
  -test-mode
        Run the program in test mode. In this mode the program will always return the same test data. To work with samba_statusd both programs needs to run in test mode or not.
  -test-pipe
        Requests status from samba_statusd and exits. May be combinde with -test-mode.
  -verbose
        With this flag the program will print verbose output
  -web.listen-address string
        Address to listen on for web interface and telemetry. (default ":9922")
  -web.telemetry-path string
        Path under which to expose metrics. (default "/metrics")
```

You may not want to start the service with arguments that will exit before listening starts like `-test-pipe`, `-help` or `-print-version`.

To stop, start or restart the service use `systemctl`, e. g.: `sudo systemctl stop samba_exporter`. To read the log output use `journalctl`, e. g. `sudo journalctl -u samba_exporter`.

**Remark:** Due to the services dependencies `samba_exporter` service stops whenever `samba_statusd` stops. And `samba_statusd` always starts when `samba_exporter` is started if not already running.

## Prometheus

To add this exporter to your [prometheus database](https://prometheus.io/) you have to add the endpoint as scrape job to the `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` on your prometheus server. Therefor add the lines shown below:

```yaml
  - job_name: 'Samba exporter node on server.local'
    metrics_path: metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['server.local:9922']
```

Replace `server.local` with the network name of your samba server.

## Grafana

For [grafana](https://grafana.com) an example dashboard is installed with the debian package and can be found at `/usr/share/doc/samba_exporter-Vx.y/grafana/SambaService.json` (Replace x.y with the current version).

When [importing](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/export-import/#import-dashboard) this dashboard you need to change `server.local` to the network name of your samba server.

## Build and manual install

To build the project you need [Go](https://golang.org/) Version 1.16.x and [Java](https://java.com/) Version 11 on your development machine. 
On your target machine, the samba server you want to monitor, you need [samba](https://www.samba.org/) and [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) installed.

To build the software change to the repositories directory and run:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

For manual install on the `target` machine do the following copies:

```sh
scp ./bin/samba_exporter <target>:/usr/bin/samba_exporter
scp ./bin/samba_statusd <target>:/usr/bin/samba_statusd 
scp ./install/usr/bin/start_samba_statusd <target>:/usr/bin/start_samba_statusd
scp ./install/lib/systemd/system/samba_statusd.service <target>:/lib/systemd/system/samba_statusd.service
scp ./install/lib/systemd/system/samba_exporter.service <target>:/lib/systemd/system/samba_exporter.service
scp install/etc/default/samba_exporter <target>:/etc/default/samba_exporter
scp install/etc/default/samba_statusd <target>:/etc/default/samba_statusd
```

Now login to your target machine and run the commands below to enable the services and create the needed user and group:

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable samba_statusd.service
systemctl enable samba_exporter.service
addgroup --system samba-exporter
adduser --system --no-create-home --disabled-login samba-exporter
adduser samba-exporter samba-exporter
```

Finally you are abel to start the services:

```sh
systemctl start samba_statusd.service
systemctl start samba_exporter.service
```

Test the `samba_exporter` by requesting metrics with `curl`:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:9922/metrics 
```

The output of this test should look something like this:

```txt
# HELP go_gc_duration_seconds A summary of the pause duration of garbage collection cycles.
# TYPE go_gc_duration_seconds summary
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 0

```

### Developer Hints

In case you want develop this software with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you need to add the repositories root folder to the **GOPATH** within the `VS Code Settings` to get golang extension and golang tools work, e. g.:

```json
{
      "go.gopath": "${env:GOPATH}:${workspaceFolder}",
}
```
